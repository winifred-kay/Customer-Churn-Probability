# Customer-Churn-Probability

#Introduction

As businesses strive to maximize their profitability, one important metric that they must keep track of is customer churn (customer attrition). This refers to the percentage of customers who stop using a company's service or product for a duration. High customer churn rate can be detrimental to a business, as they can indicate high dissatisfaction levels and reduce revenue to the company.

To mitigate customer churn, businesses can employ various strategies,including loyalty programs and high targeted market campaign but without accurate insights into customer behaviour, the company may not know which approach to take and this is where machine learning becomes useful. 

Machine learning can be used to predict which customers are at risk of churning by analyzing historical data, identifying patterns and other statistical techniques. This article will delve into the use of the CRISP-DM frame work to build a classification model that can predict customer churn using customer data and behavioral characteristics. 

#Objective

To build a classifaction model that accurately predict if a cutomer will churn or not.

# Resources and Tools

1. A dataset  

2. Jupyter Notebook: scikit learn, pandas profiling, pandas, matplolib, seaborn and other machine learning libraries.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

One of the biggest challenge in building a classifiaction model that make prediction is to identify the relevant features in your data. Identifying relevant features can help you differentiate between churn and non churn customers, this requires a deep business understanding and extensive data analysis to identify patterns and trends in data. Using the approach of asking questions and coming up with hypothesis helps in data understanding. The hypothesis and questions below was formulated to help understand the data.

##### Hypothesis

Null: 25% of customers are likely to Churn.
Alternative: 75% of customers does not churn

1. What is the churn to not churn ratio?

2. Which gender group is likely to churn?

3. How many customers have our phoneService?

4. How many customer have online security?

5. How many customers have tech Support?
